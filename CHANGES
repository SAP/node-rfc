Breaking changes

1. Managed clients' can't open and close own connections any more. Instead of open() and close(),
managed clients use pool acquire() and release() methods. Delegation of these tasks to Pool,
ensures the connection handle stability during the Client instance lifecycle (less or not at all RFC_INVALID_HANDLE errors)
and more intuitive error messages, like RFM call() over closed connection instead of generic RFC_INVALID_HANDLE error.

2. After critical errors, the client connection handle is set to NULL, consequently setting the alive property to false.
The alive property now exposes the connection handle != NULL condition, thus always in sync. The automatic re-open should
assign the new connection handle to client, setting the alive to true: see Closing connections.

3. Client reopen() method removed

4. Client ping() method result returned as a second callback parameter (callback pattern), error is the first

5. Client getters:
    - status and runningRFCCalls removed
    - isAlive replaced with alive
    - _connectionHandle replaced with connectionHandle
    - version replaced with more generic environment object, exposing:
        - os platform name, architecture, release
        - node, napi, modules etc. versions (process.versions)
        - SAPNWRFC_HOME and RFC_INI environment variables

6. The ongoing RFC call is not any more protected from connection close() by direct client.
   The direct clients should not call the close() method before the RFM call completed and
   invoke() or call() callback invoked.

7. Error handling improvements:
    - All error objects have now a name property, defining the error type
    - Error location path (rfm/parameter/field) attached to error objects, property rfmPath
